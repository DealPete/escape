# Escape!

This is a remake of the classic Apple ][ game Escape! by Silas Warner (author of [Castle Wolfenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Wolfenstein)). It uses the [Simple Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org) and can be compiled to any system. To get it working on MacOS,

1. Download the code with `git clone https://www.github.com/dealpete/escape.git`.
2. Use [Home Brew](https:/brew.sh) to install the packages `sfml` and `imagemagick`.
3. Change to the project root directory and `make`.
